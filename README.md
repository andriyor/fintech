A payment processor is the middleman that securely moves transaction data between the merchant, acquiring bank, card networks, and issuing bank.

The payment processor is responsible for:

- Transmitting transaction data between the merchant, acquiring bank, and card network
- Encrypting sensitive payment information to prevent fraud
- Handling authorization requests from card issuers
- Ensuring compliance with security standards (PCI DSS)
- Managing refunds, voids, and chargebacks

Examples of Payment Processors: Stripe, PayPal, Square, Adyen, Worldpay, Fiserv, Authorize.net

**Refund**

A refund is when a merchant voluntarily returns the transaction amount to the customer, typically due to a return, dissatisfaction, or an issue with the product/service.

**Chargeback**

A chargeback is when a customer files a dispute with their issuing bank, asking them to forcibly reverse the transaction.
Merchants should prioritize refunds to avoid chargebacks whenever possible.
